# Corrupted probabilities

This repo is a fork of LinearPartition with the EternaFold [LinearPartition patch](https://github.com/eternagame/EternaFold/blob/master/LinearPartition-E.patch) applied, as described in the [instructions](https://github.com/eternagame/EternaFold/blob/master/README_LinearFold-E_patch.md). Note that this repo was forked from the [latest `b450fb3` commit](https://github.com/LinearFold/LinearPartition/commit/b450fb3e63189073b68d385589035f992080aa3a) of LinearPartition, not from the `ae6507f` commit, because the former commit was still using Python2.

The main goal of these tests is to determine the source of a [bug](https://github.com/eternagame/EternaFold/issues/2), which produces corrupted pairing probabilities $p_i$ that are larger than 1. We used 4 different methods to obtain the pairing probability matrix:

1. EternaFold
2. LinearPartition with default Contrafold parameters
2. LinearPartition with ViennaRNA parameters
2. LinearPartition with EternaFold parameters

We tested a partial MS2 sequence ($L=836$) and randomly generated sequences to determine which methods produce corrupted pairing probabilities.

## Running the tests
1. Clone and compile this LinearPartition fork:
````
git clone https://github.com/domen13/LinearPartition
cd LinearPartition
git checkout eternafold_patch
make
````
2. Clone and compile EternaFold:
````
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/eternagame/EternaFold
cd EternaFold
make
````

3. If needed, change the EternaFold path (`ETERNAFOLDPATH`) in `fold`.
5. Run `python MS2_analysis.py`.
5. Set desired testing parameters in `random_analysis.py` (`num_sequences` and `L`) and run `python random_analysis.py`.


## MS2 results

Results are shown specifically for the two of problematic nucleotides (571 and 572) and also for the whole sequence. Using LinearPartition (either with default Contrafold or with Eternafold parameters) doesn't give corrupted pairing probabilities, while EternaFold and LinearPartition (ViennaRNA parameters) give corrupted probabilities.

## Random sequences results

Results show that we weren't able to get corrupted probabilities with either `LinearPartition (c)` or `LinearPartition (e)`, while both `EternaFold` and `LinearPartition (v)` give corrupted probabilities (and their occurrence seems to increase with the sequence length).

## Solution

Changing `<float>` to `<double>` in `Contrafold.cpp:121` seems to solve the issue.
